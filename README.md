This repository contains two projects I did in python in my first computer science class at UMBC. This shows the number of years I have had experience with different programming languages, including python.

The first project is a simple battleship project based on the popular board game.

The second project called silison crisis, is a game where the user must produce materials to build more factories and mines which produce more materials and so on. The user is able to build up a collection of materials and display them.
The game is mainly just practice with python and using classes and objects.
